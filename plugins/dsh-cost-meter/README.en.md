## Feature overview

| Feature | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Per-conversation cost | Below the composer / session title bar | Live accumulated cost + input/cache/output tokens; position configurable |
| Official balance | Sidebar top / Settings page (configurable) | Total / granted / topped-up balance, auto-refresh + manual refresh; optional three-segment progress bar (blue/orange/gray), whose today segment only counts official-channel spend (coding plans / custom providers excluded) |
| Custom provider balance | Sidebar / Settings page (configurable) | Configurable HTTP balance lookup (e.g. LiteLLM); bilingual labels, currency, extract rules (dot path / number / add / subtract / divide — use divide for NewApi-style quota endpoints, see [example](#custom-provider-balance-example-newapi-template)); collapsible panel alongside Coding Plan quotas |
| OpenCode Go quota | Sidebar / Settings / bottom-right dock (configurable) | Rolling-5h / weekly / monthly usage percent and reset times, each window toggleable independently, budget used % can show alongside; key auto-discovered (DSH credential store OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY / env / opencode login) or entered manually |
| Coding plan quotas | Sidebar / Settings page (per vendor) | Multi-vendor coding-plan quota queries (Anthropic Claude Pro/Max, Z.ai / Zhipu GLM Coding Plan, MiniMax Token Plan, Kimi/Moonshot balance, OpenRouter credits, SiliconFlow balance, CommandCode 5h/weekly windows + monthly credits balance); per-vendor enable switch, key, display position and refresh interval (sidebar card in the same box style as the Go quota; the collapsed rail shows percentages), credentials only sent to official endpoints; neutral hints when no credentials/subscription; SCNet Token Plan has no quota API — monthly usage is estimated from the local ledger via the official credits deduction table (no credentials needed) |
| Quota strip | Above the input box (toggle in Display settings) | One compact chip row for budget used % / the Go main window / each enabled coding-plan usage window (short label + mini progress bar, ≥80% warn, ≥100% over, hover for reset times); a first-run guide card lets you decide whether to enable it; hides itself when there is no quota data |
| Click to refresh | Sidebar balance/quota boxes | Click the official balance / custom balance / coding-plan box (collapsed rail included) to fetch the latest data immediately; the box pulses while refreshing, failures keep the previous value and surface the reason in the hover tooltip; keyboard Enter/Space also triggers; a one-time guide card appears after the update |
| Today's cost | Sidebar bottom (above the settings button) | “Today ¥x”, hover for call count and token details |
| Budget box | Sidebar bottom (between the balance row and the settings button) | Rounded-square frame: budget, used %, progress bar, today's cost & share of budget, used/limit; ≥80% warning, ≥100% over-budget |
| Summary cards | Settings page | Today / this month / cumulative cost and call counts |
| Token usage stats | Settings page (Cost section) | All-time token totals (input/cache/output/calls) + a Codex-style 26-week daily usage heat grid that fills the settings width; hover a cell for that day's detail |
| Today's sessions | Settings page | Per-session call count, input/cache/output tokens and cost |
| History | Settings page | Per-day totals; retention days configurable (default 180) |
| Pre-install history import | Automatic on first launch | After install/upgrade, the first launch automatically replays all host session logs to import conversations from before the plugin was installed (missing dates are rebuilt whole; existing dates only gain previously unknown sessions; idempotent and never double-counts live metering; costs priced at per-event historical rates); a manual re-run entry remains in Settings |
| Budget settings | Settings page, top | Limit, period (today / month / cumulative / custom date range), used % |
| Price table | Settings page | Per-model off-peak / peak prices (input/output shorthand supported; cache prices derived automatically); fully editable |
| Peak/off-peak hours display | Settings / budget / today | Shows UTC peak hours 01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00 with the current tier; expanded view shows a peak/off-peak period strip (current period + countdown), collapsed (rail) view shows a vertical peak/off-peak progress bar; independently toggleable |
| Peak/off-peak switch popup alert | Global overlay | A full-width bracketed popup appears when the next tier switch is within the configured lead time (default 2 minutes, 1–30), with an alert-colored badge distinguishing entering peak vs off-peak; position selectable (**bottom-right / screen center**), alert type selectable (entering peak / entering off-peak / both), one alert per switch point; optionally **sends a browser (system) notification** (so you still get alerted when the page is backgrounded; requires granting notification permission); configured in the peak pricing panel in Settings, with a **one-click popup preview** (rendered by the real component — copy, position and notifications exactly as they will fire) |
| Official price sync | Settings page | Fetches and parses the official pricing page, applies with one click |
| UI language | Settings → Display settings | Simplified Chinese / English / Follow browser (auto); switches instantly and auto-saves |
| AI price sync | [prompt](docs/AI-PRICE-SYNC-PROMPT.en.md) | DeepSeek official sync; other providers use the verified official price catalog and manual configuration |
| Model & Plan adaptation guide | [adaptation doc](docs/model-and-plan-adaptation.en.md) | Adaptation matrix for per-model billing and the 8 Coding Plan vendors, the auto-matching mechanism and price sources ([中文](docs/model-and-plan-adaptation.md)) |
| Peak/off-peak alert guide | [alert doc](docs/peak-alert.en.md) | Fully illustrated guide to the pre-switch popup and system notification: effect screenshots (EN/中文), settings reference and usage tips ([中文](docs/peak-alert.md)) |
| Multi-provider billing | Settings / ledger | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral and other providers with input/output, cache and reasoning-token pricing isolated by provider + model |
| Model-name auto-matching | Settings / ledger | Unknown model ids are matched against the price table: case/spaces/hyphens/dots and bracket annotations (e.g. (go)) are ignored — a normalized-equal or containing name hits (e.g. `gpt5.6 luna(go)`); router providers (opencode/zen etc.) search across all vendors; can be restricted to exact match, and unmatched models can be pinned to a specific entry in Settings |
| Extended price catalog | Settings → Extended price catalog | Built-in reference catalog grouped by vendor and model family (expandable; vendors collapsed by default); mount entries into billing with one click — mounted third-party models live inside the catalog and stay editable; a per-model “Show directly in Cost settings” toggle chooses which models (DeepSeek included) appear directly in the price table |

## Custom provider balance example (NewApi template)

The `extract` rules accept four forms: a numeric constant, a dot path string, `add`/`subtract` over multiple paths, and `divide` scaling by a `by` divisor. **`divide` fits NewApi and other endpoints that meter balance in integer quota** (1 USD = 500000 quota — the same conversion cc-switch uses).

For NewApi `GET /api/usage/token` (response `{ "code": 200, "data": { "total_granted": ..., "total_used": ..., "total_available": ..., "unlimited_quota": false } }`):

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "display": "both",
  "refreshMinutes": 15,
  "label": "NewApi",
  "labelEn": "NewApi",
  "unit": "USD",
  "request": {
    "url": "https://your-newapi-host/api/usage/token",
    "method": "GET",
    "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer {{NEWAPI_API_KEY}}" }
  },
  "extract": {
    "remaining": { "op": "divide", "path": "data.total_available", "by": 500000 },
    "maxBudget": { "op": "divide", "path": "data.total_granted", "by": 500000 },
    "spend": { "op": "divide", "path": "data.total_used", "by": 500000 },
    "unit": "USD"
  }
}
```

- `{{NEWAPI_API_KEY}}` resolves from the DSH credential vault or an environment variable (**placeholders work in headers only** — the URL must be a literal address);
- Unlimited-quota tokens (`unlimited_quota: true`) have no `total_available`, so `remaining` cannot be extracted and the query reports “remaining is missing or not numeric” — use a limited-quota token or a middle-layer endpoint that converts the units;
- Entry point: Settings → Cost (Quota tab) → “Custom provider balance” → expand config; or write `config.customBalance` in `storages/cost-meter/ledger.json`.

## Bilingual UI

The plugin UI (session badge, sidebar balance row & budget box, and the entire Settings page) supports **Simplified Chinese** and **English**:

- Language options: **Simplified Chinese** / **English** / **Follow browser (auto)**;
- Default is “Follow browser”: the browser language is auto-detected (`zh*` → Chinese, otherwise English), and the detected value is written back into the config so server-side messages (balance query, price sync, etc.) match the UI language;
- Switch it under **Settings → Cost → Display settings → Language** — the whole plugin UI updates instantly and auto-saves; the section label in the Settings sidebar switches too (费用 / Cost);
- Server-generated notices (balance refresh, official price sync, config validation errors, …) are also output in the current language.

## Screenshots & walkthrough

> All screenshots were captured on a live DeepSeek Harness instance. They show the Chinese UI by default; the plugin UI itself is bilingual (Simplified Chinese / English) — switch to English under Settings → Cost → Display settings → Language.

### Main page

**Sidebar bottom** (top to bottom: official balance → quota/budget box → settings button):

![Sidebar footer](docs/screenshot-sidebar-footer.png)

- The balance row shows the official open-platform total balance; hovering reveals the granted/topped-up split; with “Balance progress bar” enabled, both official and custom balances use the same three-segment box (blue = remaining, orange = today, gray = spent);
- With no budget enabled, that spot shows the “Today ¥x” badge.

**Balance progress bar & custom provider settings**:

| Sidebar progress bar + display settings | Custom provider balance panel |
|---|---|
| ![Balance progress bar](docs/screenshot-balance-progress-bar-zh.png) | ![Custom provider settings](docs/screenshot-custom-balance-settings-zh.png) |

- Display settings → global “Balance progress bar” toggle; optional “Budget cap” overrides API `max_budget`;
- Settings → Cost → “Custom provider balance”: expand to edit URL / headers (JSON) / extract (JSON), bilingual names, and currency.

**Quota / budget box — three states** (OpenCode Go quota and the budget each toggle independently in the same rounded style; with both on they **merge into one card** — Go on top, budget below, thin divider, each keeps its own warning colors; the “box details” toggle collapses secondary rows to just label + used % + progress bar):

| Go quota only | Budget only | Merged |
|---|---|---|
| ![Go quota only](docs/screenshot-go-box.png) | ![Budget only](docs/screenshot-budget-box.png) | ![Merged card](docs/screenshot-sidebar-footer-v2.png) |

- The budget box shows “budget · used % · progress bar · today's cost & share of budget · used/limit”; ≥80% warning, ≥100% over-budget; rail mode narrows to a percentage tile;
- The peak/off-peak hours display shows UTC peak hours 01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00 with the current tier; the budget box and today's cost area show a compact one-line period strip — a thin orange/blue track with a marker line on the current period, and text on the right showing the current period plus the countdown to the next switch (refreshed every 30 seconds); no prices are shown; it can be disabled independently in Settings, and the “Peak period strip style” option switches between the Compact and Classic looks; collapsed rail mode shows the same design vertically with a short horizontal label (“Peak / Off-peak”) below — the countdown and full text appear on hover;

**Peak/off-peak period strip & collapsed vertical progress bar**:

| Settings peak panel (notice toggle / style switch / preview) | Settings bottom-right (dock) display & box details |
|---|---|
| ![Peak/off-peak pricing & notice panel](docs/peak-panel-settings-en.png) | ![Dock display & box details settings](docs/dock-display-settings-en.png) |

Real captures from an actual DSH sidebar of the period strip and collapsed vertical bar (current looks), grouped by UI type (shown during peak hours):

**Expanded** — the budget box / today's cost area shows a one-line period strip:

| Compact | Classic |
|---|---|
| ![Expanded · Compact](docs/peak-strip-expanded-compact-en.png) | ![Expanded · Classic](docs/peak-strip-expanded-classic-en.png) |

- Compact: thin orange/blue track with a marker line on the current period and a short caption, e.g. “Peak · Off-peak in 1h 40m”;
- Classic: same track and marker line with the full caption “Peak · Off-peak in HH:MM:SS” countdown (refreshed every 30 seconds); no prices are shown.

**Collapsed (rail)** — a vertical period bar stacked at the sidebar bottom, centered with the percentage squares:

| Compact | Classic |
|---|---|
| ![Collapsed · Compact](docs/peak-strip-rail-compact-en.png) | ![Collapsed · Classic](docs/peak-strip-rail-classic-en.png) |

- Compact: only the short horizontal label (“Peak / Off-peak”) below the vertical bar;
- Classic: the full caption stacked vertically below the bar, including the countdown to the next switch; in both styles the full text is also available on hover.

- The display follows the `peakNotice` / `peakEnabled` / `peakEffectiveAt` / `peakWindows` gates and uses the configured UTC peak windows;
- Settings → Cost → Peak/off-peak pricing includes an independent “Prominent notice during peak hours” toggle; turning it off hides both the expanded strip and the collapsed vertical bar;
- The first image above is the Settings peak panel (notice toggle, style switch and live preview); see the grouped captures for the strip and collapsed vertical bar; the dock toggles and box-details switches are shown in the second image.

- The Go box shows the main window's used % and progress bar (default rolling 5h; switchable to weekly/monthly in Display settings), with the other two windows and reset times in a row below:

![Rail mode](docs/screenshot-sidebar-rail-v2.png)

**Bottom-right (dock) quota / budget chips** (enabled in Display settings; four independent toggles: 5h / weekly / monthly quota + budget used %):

| Corner chips in action | Display settings (where the toggles live) |
|---|---|
| ![Corner chips](docs/screenshot-display-corner-v2.png) | ![Dock display settings](docs/dock-display-settings-en.png) |

**Per-conversation cost** (two positions, switchable in Settings):

| Below the composer | Session title bar |
|---|---|
| ![Session dock](docs/screenshot-session-dock.png) | ![Session header](docs/screenshot-session-header.png) |

> Left: this session ¥5.5939 · input 321K · cache 119M · output 235K; right: title-bar badge “cost ¥6.1606” (real session captures)

![Session page](docs/screenshot-session.png)

### Settings → Cost

**Overview** (OpenCode Go quota → budget → balance → summary cards → today's sessions → history → display settings → price table → data & sync):

![Settings page](docs/screenshot-settings.png)

**OpenCode Go quota panel** (very top of the Settings page: three progress bars, main window highlighted, manual refresh; a neutral hint when there is no subscription, one-click disable):

![Go quota panel](docs/screenshot-settings-top-v2.png)

**Budget panel** (including custom date ranges):

![Budget](docs/screenshot-budget-panel.png)

**Balance panel** (total/granted/topped-up + manual refresh):

![Balance](docs/screenshot-balance-panel.png)

**Display settings** (Go main window & key, corner chips, box details, …):

![Display settings](docs/screenshot-display-settings-v2.png)

**Summary cards**:

![Cards](docs/screenshot-cards.png)

**Token usage stats** (all-time totals + a Codex-style 26-week heat grid filling the settings width; translucent glass cells for unused days):

![Token usage stats](docs/screenshot-usage-grid.png)

**Today's sessions / history** (input, cache and output tokens in separate columns):

![Today's sessions](docs/screenshot-table-1.png) ![History](docs/screenshot-table-2.png)

**Price table** (off-peak / peak tiers, with input/output shorthand support, USD / 1M tokens):

![Price table](docs/screenshot-price-card.png)

**Data & sync** (instant auto-save of settings + official price sync + clear history):

![Sync](docs/screenshot-sync.png)

## Installation

> Requirements: Node.js ≥ 20 + DeepSeek Harness (a version with the `dsh plugin` command; `npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh`).

### One-click install (recommended)

**npm package name** (published to the npm registry, always tracks the latest version; no git needed):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-cost-meter
```

**PowerShell one-click script** (copy the whole line, paste, press Enter; pnpm is provisioned automatically, git is auto-detected — no clone needed; the install chain is **pinned to the release tag `v1.5.36`** — review the script before running):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Han-1413141/dsh-cost-meter/v1.5.36/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Or a plain command line** (the machine must already have pnpm and git; also pinned to the tag):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Han-1413141/dsh-cost-meter#v1.5.36
```

Without git, use the GitHub tag archive:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/Han-1413141/dsh-cost-meter/archive/refs/tags/v1.5.36.tar.gz
```

After installing, **restart** `dsh web` (plugin rows, the Typert manifest and the client bundle are all scanned at startup):

```sh
dsh web
```

### Update / Uninstall

```sh
# update: re-run the new release's install.ps1 (the pinned tag inside it moves with the release)
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-cost-meter  # uninstall
```

### Local development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Han-1413141/dsh-cost-meter.git
cd <parent directory of the clone>
dsh plugin --profile web add link:./dsh-cost-meter  # symlink; edit lib/client.js, refresh the page, done
```

## Billing rules

![Billing rules & peak/off-peak pricing](docs/diagram-pricing.en.svg)

- Price units match the official docs: **USD / 1M tokens**;
- cost = cache-missed input × cache-miss + output × output + (cache read + cache write) × cache-hit (cache writes follow the legacy official rule and are billed at the hit price);
- **Pure two-tier peak/off-peak pricing** (the official scheme since 2026-08): peak hours (01:00–04:00, 06:00–10:00 UTC) bill at the peak price and all other hours at the off-peak price (off-peak = half of peak). The base tier equals the off-peak tier, and billing falls back to off-peak when peak/off-peak is disabled; the Settings page shows the live tier (peak / off-peak); the budget/today's cost area shows a peak/off-peak period strip (current/next period with countdown), and the collapsed rail shows a vertical peak/off-peak progress bar;
- **Historical billing correctness**: calls before 2026-08-16 16:00 UTC (the peak-era boundary) are billed at the base prices of that time, and later calls at the two-tier scheme;
- The ledger always stores amounts in **USD**; currency and FX rate only affect display (default 1 USD = 7.2 CNY, configurable);
- The session badge is **billed exactly** at the moment each call is made (host-exported per-call cost), just like daily/monthly/cumulative totals and the budget;
- Billing sources are the `usage` block of every model call (including sub-agents, compression, title generation and other auxiliary calls), matching the billable view;
- Budget and over-budget warnings **only warn — they never block calls**.

## Data storage

- Ledger: `$DSH_HOME/storages/cost-meter/ledger.json` (atomic write + 2-second debounce; retained per `historyDays`, up to 200 per-session entries per day);
- Every settings change is **saved instantly and automatically** (600 ms debounce) — no manual save needed;
- Delete the ledger file to reset everything, or use “Clear all history” in Settings.

```

Data channels:

- **Per-conversation cost**: the host registers the `costUsage` session projection (pure token buckets, split per model); the browser reads it via `useProjection('costUsage')` and prices it with the current price table;
- **Global ledger / budget / balance / config**: `costMeter/getState | updateConfig | fetchPrices | refreshBalance | resetHistory` over the Typert gateway RPC (`remote.costMeter.*`);
- **Balance**: calls the official `GET {baseURL}/user/balance`, reusing the same API key as model requests (credential service / env var), with an in-process cache expiring per `refreshMinutes`.

The plugin never imports cordis/dsh Service/Context runtime classes (only Node builtins, zod, and pure functions from dsh-home-paths and dsh-credentials), so it shares one runtime instance with the host with no duplicated dependency risk.

## How official price sync works

`fetchPrices` fetches the official pricing page (Docusaurus server-side pre-rendered) and parses:

1. the base price table (transposed layout: first row MODEL + model ids, price labels followed by the prices);
2. the peak/off-peak price table (two rows per model: OFF-PEAK / PEAK);
3. the effective time (“take effect at …”) and the peak-hour windows (“Peak hours are …”).

The parsed result is written into the price table and persisted; if the page structure changes, sync reports an error and keeps the previous prices, with manual editing as a fallback.

## AI price sync

[docs/AI-PRICE-SYNC-PROMPT.en.md](docs/AI-PRICE-SYNC-PROMPT.en.md) (English) and [docs/AI-PRICE-SYNC-PROMPT.md](docs/AI-PRICE-SYNC-PROMPT.md) (中文) provide prompts you can copy straight into any AI:
the AI reads the official pricing on its own → outputs per-model, time-of-day (base/off-peak/peak + effective time) price JSON → you review and apply it (Settings page / RPC / file — pick one). Handy when the official prices change.

## Development & verification

```sh
corepack pnpm install                                   # dependencies

node test/verify.mjs                                    # pure-module verification (parsing/billing/ledger/config)
node test/mock-balance.mjs                              # (optional) local balance API mock: 3101
dsh --profile web --dump-config                         # composition-tree check
dsh --profile web --port 3099                           # real startup (watch logs and the UI)
```

## Known limitations

- Official-page parsing depends on the current page structure; after a redesign, “Sync prices from official docs” fails — edit the price table manually as a fallback;
- The session badge is estimated at the current price tier; exact figures come from the ledger;
- Price sync overwrites the same-named models listed on the official page; custom model entries are unaffected;
- Balance lookup needs network access to api.deepseek.com and a valid API key; **the API key is only ever sent to the official domain** (if baseURL points at a non-official host, balance queries refuse to run — model requests are unaffected);
- The OpenCode Go quota endpoint is the official opencode.ai endpoint (community-documented); if its response shape changes, the Settings page shows an error and the display can be turned off in Display settings;
- A restart of `dsh web` is required after installing/updating the plugin.
